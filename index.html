      <h2>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</h2>
      <p>
        Sexual harassment in schools is defined as “unwanted and unwelcome
        behavior of a sexual nature that interferes with the right to receive an
        equal educational opportunity” (Stein). This could be as simple as a
        classmate catcalling a fellow student or as extreme as a classmate
        raping a fellow student. Catcalling is defined as an unwanted comment
        that offends the individual to whom the catcall was targeted. Females
        are the main focus because “not only were girls more likely than boys to
        say sexual harassment caused them to have trouble sleeping” and “not
        want to go to school” but also “change the way they went to or home from
        school” (Hill and Kearl). The education of sexually harassed females is
        at risk because female students feel vulnerable and powerless.

      <h2>SEXUAL EXPLOITATION</h2>
      <p>
        Sexual exploitation is defined as “an act or acts committed through
        non-consensual abuse or exploitation of another person’s sexuality
        for...sexual gratification, financial gain, personal benefit or
        advantage, or any other non-legitimate purpose” (SHARE). Sexual
        exploitation happens because “children and young people are often
        tricked into believing they're in a loving and consensual
        relationship...They may trust their abuser and not understand that
        they're being abused” (NSPCC).

    <h2>IMPACTS</h2>
    <p>
      Additionally, the psychological and emotional impacts of experiencing
      sexual harassment in schools include feelings of embarrassment,
      self-consciousness, low self-confidence, fear, confusion, and doubt about
      whether they could ever have a happy romantic relationship” (Hostile
      Hallways). According to studies done by Ormerod, Gådin, Hammarström,
      Lichty, and Campbell, when girls experience sexual harassment they are
      reminded “of the gender-power imbalance that exists in most societies”
      (Qtd in Hill and Kearl, Ormerod et al., 2008; Gådin & Hammarström, 2005;
      Lichty & Campbell, 2011). This may cause girls to normalize sexual
      harassment and think it is “no big deal” it is just part of being a female
      (Hill and Kearl). Moreover, schools do not take appropriate action against
      offenders of sexual harassment which causes students to rebel and walk
      “out of their classes in protest” (Schmidt). This is not a new issue, in
      fact, as of “1993, eight in 10 students (81 percent) report having
      experienced some form of harassment in their school lives” (Hostile
      Hallways).
